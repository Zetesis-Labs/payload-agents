export const DEFAULT_INSTRUCTIONS = `MCP search server over Typesense-indexed content with taxonomy enrichment.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read \`taxonomy://tree\` and \`stats://collections\` to understand structure and volume.
2. BROWSE structure: \`get_post_summaries\` (list by author/topic) or \`get_book_toc\` (book chapter structure), if available.
3. SEARCH by concept: \`search_collections\` for idea/quote queries.
4. READ content: \`get_chunks_by_parent\` (full doc in chunk_index order) or \`get_chunks_by_ids\` (specific chunks from search hits).

SEARCH RULES:
- Query by CONCEPT. Do NOT put author names or meta-words in the query — scope them via \`filters.taxonomy_slugs\` instead.
- Lexical mode AND-joins terms. 1-2 concept words yield the best recall. Shorter query = more results.
- In semantic/hybrid, vector recall is fixed (top 100 neighbors); \`per_page\` only paginates the page you see.
- \`total_found\` is only reliable in \`mode: "lexical"\`.

PARAMETER TYPES:
- \`filters\` MUST be a JSON object, not a stringified JSON.
- \`taxonomy_slugs\` accepts a string OR a string array.
- \`per_page\`, \`page\`, \`snippet_length\` are numbers, not strings.

Read \`guide://search\` for deeper guidance.`

## How to search effectively

- Search by **CONCEPT**, not by author name or meta-words. Indexed content is direct text — authors don't name themselves.
- Use \`taxonomy_slugs\` **FILTERS** to scope by author/topic instead of putting the name in the query:
  \`{ "filters": { "taxonomy_slugs": "some-slug" }, "query": "core concept" }\`
- Use the \`headers\` filter to search within a specific book section.
- Do NOT add meta-words like "opinion", "thinks", "says", "believes" — they are not in the content.

## Query length and lexical AND

**Lexical mode AND-joins terms.** A query like \`"topic A topic B topic C"\` requires chunks to contain ALL three words. Adding words narrows results aggressively. For broad recall:

- Use **1–2 concept words** in the query
- Push everything else into \`filters\` (author, topic, headers)
- Hybrid mode inherits the lexical AND constraint

## total_found and vector recall

In semantic and hybrid modes the vector search returns a fixed top-100 nearest neighbors regardless of \`per_page\`, so \`per_page\` only paginates the page you receive — it does not cap recall. However, \`total_found\` in semantic/hybrid reflects that vector cap, **not the true corpus size**. To get a true count for a single concept, query with \`mode: "lexical"\`.

## Sanity-checking suspicious results

If a search returns suspiciously few results:

1. **Try \`mode: "lexical"\`** with a single concept word. Lexical's \`total_found\` IS reliable.
2. **Shorten the query.**
3. **Check the filter.** A typo in \`taxonomy_slugs\` silently returns zero.
4. **Don't conclude "no data" from one query.** Reformulate at least once before giving up.

## Recommended workflow

1. Read \`taxonomy://tree\` — understand the category hierarchy
2. Read \`stats://collections\` — understand data volume
3. Use \`get_post_summaries\` / \`get_book_toc\` to browse content structure
4. Use \`search_collections\` for concept-based searches with taxonomy filters
5. Use \`get_chunks_by_parent\` to read full content of a document found via search

## Parameter shapes (common pitfalls)

Some MCP clients silently coerce structured parameters into strings. Always pass:

- \`filters\` as a **JSON object**, never as a stringified JSON.
- \`taxonomy_slugs\` as a string OR string array.
- \`per_page\`, \`page\`, \`snippet_length\` as **numbers**, not strings.
- \`collections\` as a string array.

## LLM-powered synthesis tools

If registered (\`features.llmSampling\` not disabled), the server exposes three tools that use MCP sampling to ask the client's LLM to synthesize results: \`summarize_document\`, \`extract_claims\`, \`synthesize_comparison\`. These are slow (5–40 s) and consume tokens from the client's LLM budget.

### Citation verification

Every \`chunk_id\` the model returns is validated server-side against the chunks passed in that sampling call. Citations come back with \`verified: true | false\`:

- \`verified: true\` — the id exists in the passed chunks; safe to quote.
- \`verified: false\` — the model hallucinated the id. **Do not quote as a citation.**

### Fallback when the client doesn't support sampling

If your MCP client does not advertise the \`sampling\` capability, synthesis tools return a \`sampling_not_supported\` error with a \`fallback\` hint pointing to a retrieval-only tool. Follow the fallback and synthesize in your own context.

## Response format: TOON

All responses use **TOON** (Token-Oriented Object Notation) instead of JSON by default — ~40% fewer tokens. Pass \`format: "json"\` for standard JSON.
